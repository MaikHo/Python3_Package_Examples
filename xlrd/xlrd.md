### What it is good for?

Read Excel documents.

The `xlrd` module reads a spreadsheet into a hierarchical data structure. On top are sheets, consisting of rows which in turn consist of columns.
The corresponding Python module `xlwt` allows you to write Excel spreadsheets. You may also consider the newer `openpyxl` module.

### Example

    # Create a simple Excel file 'hamlet.xlsx' to begin with!

    sheet_names = workbook.sheet_names()
    sheet = workbook.sheet_by_name(sheet_names[0])

    for row_idx in range(sheet.nrows):
        for col_idx in range(sheet.ncols):
            cell = sheet.cell(row_idx, col_idx)
            print(cell.value, end="\t")
