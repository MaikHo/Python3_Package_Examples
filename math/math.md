In the module, you find various trigonometric and exponential functions. In addition the two constants `pi` and `e` are included.

### Installed with Python by default

yes

### Example

Calculating a **square root**, a **sine**, an **exponential function** and a **logarithm**.

    import math
    
    print(math.sqrt(49))
    
    print(math.sin(math.pi / 2))
    
    print(math.exp(1.0) == math.e)
    
    print(math.log(256,2))
