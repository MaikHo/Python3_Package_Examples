# zipfile

### What it is good for?

Read and write `.zip` files.

You can add both existing files and strings to a zip file. If you are adding strings you need to specify the file name it is written to. When you extract files to a folder, the output folder is automatically created.

### Installed with Python by default

yes

### Example

Create a new zip archive and add files to it:

    import zipfile
    z = zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'w')
    z.write('myfile.txt')                   # has to exist
    z.writestr('test.txt', 'Hello World')   # new
    z.close()

List contents of the newly created zip file:

    z = zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip')
    print(z.namelist())

Extract a file to a new folder:

    print(z.extract('test.txt', 'myfolder'))
    z.close()
